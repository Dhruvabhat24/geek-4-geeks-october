##  1 Number Of Enclaves
- You are given an n x m binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell.
A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid.
Find the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.
## Your Task:
- You don't need to print or input anything. Complete the function numberOfEnclaves() which takes a 2D integer matrix grid as the input parameter and returns an integer, denoting the number of land cells.
## 2. Boolean Matrix
- Given a boolean matrix of size RxC where each cell contains either 0 or 1, modify it such that if a matrix cell matrix[i][j] is 1 then all the cells in its ith row and jth column will become 1.
## Your Task
- You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function booleanMatrix() that takes the matrix as input parameter and modifies it in-place.
- Expected Time Complexity: O(R * C)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(R + C) 
## 3. Boundary traversal of matrix 
- You are given a matrix of dimensions n x m. The task is to perform boundary traversal on the matrix in a clockwise manner.
- Complete the function boundaryTraversal() that takes matrix, n and m as input parameters and returns the list of integers that form the boundary traversal of the matrix in a clockwise manner.
## 4. Number of Distinct Sequence
